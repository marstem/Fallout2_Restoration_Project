{100}{}{You have arrived on a desert plain outside of New Reno.}
{110}{}{Você vê várias caixas repletas de produtos químicos.}
{120}{}{You see several crates filled with chemicals. You can't identify the chemicals,
 but they have been packed VERY carefully.}
{130}{}{Você vê um Vertibird.}
{140}{}{You see a Vertibird... an advanced form of helicopter. Unfortunately, you have no
 idea how to operate it.}
{150}{}{You have no idea how to operate it.}
{200}{}{(Esses caras me dão arrepios...)}
{201}{}{(Shut up. Here they come.)}
{202}{}{*Zztttt* Do you have the cargo we requested? *Zzzttt*}
{203}{}{Yes, the chemicals are all here. You can check them if you like.}
{204}{}{*Zztttt* That will not be necessary. *Zzzttt*}
{205}{}{*Zztttt* You know what will happen if the chemicals do not meet the specifications
 we requested. *Zzzttt*}
{206}{}{Right, of course. Uh, and you brought the lightbringers...?}
{207}{}{*Zztttt* The laser weapons are in our cargo bay. *Zzzttt**}
{208}{}{*Zztttt* To ensure your cooperation, we will transmit the arming sequence for them
 once the chemicals are loaded. *Zzzttt*}
{209}{}{Uh... bem... tudo bem então. Carreguem ela, garotos --}
{210}{}{*Zztttt* No. *Zzzttt*}
{211}{}{*Zztttt* We will load the cargo. *Zzzttt*}
{212}{}{Uh, right... right. Of course. Give them room, boys.}
{213}{}{All right; we're good here. The rest of you guards head back to Reno. We'll meet up with you.}
{250}{}{Olhem! Tem alguém nos espionando!}
{251}{}{Kill them!}
{252}{}{Looks like we got us a spy...!}
{253}{}{*Zztttt* Mission aborted. Cargo failsafe sequence engaged. *Zzzttt*}
{254}{}{*Zztttt* Terminate hostiles, then return to base. *Zzzttt*}
{300}{}{Não chegue perto daqueles caras de armadura. Eles podem te partir no meio.}
{301}{}{Get back in position.}
{302}{}{Stop twitching... those armored guys don't like it much.}
{350}{}{Merda! O que você está fazendo, imbecil?!}
{351}{}{Get back to your post! What the hell are you do --?!}
{352}{}{*Zztttt* Mission aborted. Cargo failsafe sequence engaged. *Zzzttt*}
{353}{}{*Zztttt* Terminate hostiles, then return to base. *Zzzttt*}
{400}{}{[Parece que tem uma porta. Abrir e embarcar?]}
{401}{}{Aham}
{402}{}{Cai fora}
{403}{}{Board the Vertibird.}
{404}{}{Leave it alone.}
{450}{}{[Once you climb inside the cargo hold, the door seals behind you! You attempt to force it open, but it won't
 budge. As you try to think of a way out, you hear the armored soldiers board the Vertibird, which then takes off with
 you trapped inside!]}
{451}{}{Uh-oh}
{452}{}{Oh, merda...}
{500}{}{These crates are filled with heavy metal canisters. Judging from the care packing
 them, you suspect that they contain some sort of hazardous chemicals.}
{550}{}{Now's probably not the best time to be striking up conversation.}
